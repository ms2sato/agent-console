# Code Quality Standards

Refer to [code-quality-standards.md](code-quality-standards.md) for detailed evaluation criteria.

## Evaluation Aspects

1. **Robustness to Change** - SRP, file size checks, open-closed principle, change localization, dependency management, encapsulation
2. **Bug Resistance** - Type safety, exhaustive type handling, null safety, error handling, input validation
3. **Readability** - Naming, magic number detection, function design, code organization
4. **Simplicity** - YAGNI, avoid accidental complexity, minimize cognitive load
5. **Consistency** - Patterns, existing pattern evaluation, API design
6. **Testability** - Isolation, observability
7. **Performance Awareness** - Algorithmic efficiency, resource management
8. **Security Mindset** - OWASP top 10, least privilege, project-specific concerns
